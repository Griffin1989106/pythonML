# SeaLion

SeaLion was designed to teach programmers the popular machine learning concepts of today in a way that gives both intution and ways of application. 
We do this through documentation that explains the models, how they work, and how to use them with examples on familiar datasets like iris, breast cancer, MNIST, etc. 
Through this library we hope newer students will learn common algorithms and those more experienced will appreciate the extra morsels of functionality. 

## Installation
The package is available on PyPi. 
Install like such : 
```shell
pip install sealion
```

## Documentation
All documentation is available with the pydoc module. However useful they may be, I highly recommend you check the examples posted on GitHub here and seeing how the classes work. 

## Machine Learning Algorithms

We have a bunch of machine learning models and functions to use on real-world data. Of course, new ones are under way!
